# `micro-oauth`

A tiny microservice that makes it easier to add OAuth authentication to your application.
This supports any provider that follows the OAuth2 protocol, like GitHub and Instagram.

## Usage

### Clone this repo

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:brunolemos/micro-oauth.git
```

### Enviroment variables

Edit the `env` field inside `now.json`. Example:

```js
{
  // The provider you are authenticating on
  "PROVIDER": "GitHub",
  // or Instagram, ...

  // The provider authorize url (to request permissions from the user)
  "AUTHORIZE_URL": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
  // or https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize, ...

  // The URL to redirect the user to once the authentication was successful
  // PS: You can also pass this as a ?callback_url parameter on AUTHORIZE_URL env variable above
  "CALLBACK_URL": "myapp://oauth/github",
  // or http://localhost:1234/my/oauth/callback/xxx, ...

  // Your application client id
  "CLIENT_ID": "abc123",

  // Your application client secret
  "CLIENT_SECRET": "abc123",

  // Provider's url to get the access token
  "GET_TOKEN_URL": "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"
  // or https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token, ...
}
```

> Create an application on the provider website (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/clients/register/), ...) to get your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` if you haven't done that already.

### Deploy

```sh
now
```


### More details

To request people authorization, you need to send them to `http://localhost:3000/` or the url generated by `now`.

> You can pass a `?scope=` query param to set the permissions you request from the user, check the provider docs ([GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/authorization/), ...)
> You can actually pass any other parameter and they will be passed to the callback as well

When authentication was successful, the user will be redirected to the `CALLBACK_URL` with the `access_token` query param set to the provider access token. You can then use that token to interact with the Provider API! (see: [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), [Instagram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/), ...)

> E.g. setting `CALLBACK_URL=myapp://oauth/github` will redirect them to `myapp://oauth/github/?access_token=abc123`. (where `abc123` is the provided access token)

> If you passed other parameters to AUTHORIZE_URL, e.g. http://xxx.com/?xxx=1, it will be passed to the callback url, e.g. http://callbackurl.com/?access_token=abc123&xxx=1

### Finish setup

To make this work you have to set the authorization callback URL on the provider website to whatever URL `now` gave you:

![Authorization callback URL: 'https://your-url.now.sh/callback'](https://s19.postimg.org/espmt065v/Screen_Shot_2017_02_28_at_02_57_26.png)

or localhost for testing:

![Authorization callback URL: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'](https://s19.postimg.org/ib1mpe71v/Screen_Shot_2017_02_28_at_02_56_54.png)

### Error handling

In case an error happens on the server, the user will be redirected to the `CALLBACK_URL` with the `error` query param set to a relevant error message.
